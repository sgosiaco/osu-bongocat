Python version of osu! bongocat.

Currently setup to only take in input of two keys. These keys can be changed through commandline arguments.
By default they are set to 'a' and 'x'.
So if you wanted 'z' and 'x' you would run "final mkb.exe z x"
To make this happen everytime without having to start it from the commandline,
you can make a shortcut to the program and in the target field add the two keys after the quotes.
